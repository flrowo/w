TITLE> SMURFando feat. Troc
p> from 23/06/2020. the video is in portuguese. i think this video is one of my most well edited videos ever, even if the editing is simple, it is funny and has a good format both in time and in audio and video quality.

as we are on march 1st and i still didn't reach 3,5k pp, i'm doing an update so we can have a more accurate tracking

i'm getting better at 1/4 patterns, but i just cannot do 1/4 streams at all, sometimes i'm able to but just when i get lucky, that's probably my next step, and it feels like i'm relearning 1/2 streams like 5-6 months ago.

i finished the beta version of my first beatmap <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1345653" >ayako saso - dodge life</a>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742944663996203120/799402345003483186/unknown.png">
i'm starting to play the "real taiko" now... i mean, i can play (getting like 90%) things like <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/2661437" > Sewerslvt - Yandere Complex [Oni] </a> and <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1320778" >m-flo loves CHEMISTRY - Astrosexy [Cosmos]</a> that are super consistent maps on density
for example, yandere complex's oni has a lot of 1/2s with some triples between, but that's an oni level, so you get a map with only 1/2s and triples with really hard patterns, and they won't repeat at all apparently...
the other one, we got no patterns at all, both for note color and note frequency... so you got something like this kddkd kdkk kkd dkdkk dk d dkdkkkd kkddkdk kkkdd dkd dd kkdkd kkd and i can get 90-93% accuracy consistently on this type of maps
and these examples are consistent maps that truly show your capacity at getting through a random beatmap style at low 4* maps, so basically i'm getting 90-95% on low 4 stars maps, and these have a lot of 1/4s training so with them i can get ready for 5* maps. and i think 5* (or high 4*) are just 4* but faster and with streams longer than 10 notes sometimes
meaning i need to get consistent at reading 1/4 streams for some seconds, like in the picture below even if the bpm is 128
<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1331624" >IOSYS - Endless Tewi-ma Park [Oni]</a>
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742944663996203120/799419934530207754/unknown.png" >
and to be honest... that's what i want for taiko, to be able to read 1/4 streams for eternity
those are my thoughts for the future now

TITLE> first 150pp play and tournaments
p> i didn't say here before, but i was playing on a 2v2 taiko tournament (<a href="https://gtsosu.com/bgts/home">BGTS</a>) with <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12371820">pls</a>. we got through group stage, but we lost to romania, so we are in the losers bracket
BUT... at night, i got my first 150pp play on a song i like a lot:
<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1251607#taiko/2602571">Yoru Naku Usagi wa Yume o Miru - UNDEAD CORPORATION<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742944663996203120/790054024912830474/unknown.png"></a>

TITLE> reached 2500pp -> top 10k and 200 BR
p> i'm starting to be able to do 1/2 200bpm streams.
for example, <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/2462306">maps like this</a>. even though that beatmap is 136 bpm, the notes are 1/3, which makes it the same as 204 bpm with 1/2 notes.

i'm starting also to be able to do triple patterns a lot more consistently.
and i started to think about changing my playstyle to 4 finger, but that's not gonna happen, i will be playing taiko the way i think is the best for fun! that is 2 finger full alt.

TITLE> let me present you: SCREEN DATA CAPTURE DESIGN
p> data capture is something really present to us, internet users, nowadays.

before internet, it was so hard to get info about everyone that used something you created, but nowadays is simple, you can store if someone clicked a button or something like that if you know a bit of social media marketing + web development or equivalent.

in the game osu! you have a pretty good example of this:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/219948537754943489/766514897630003250/taiko_screen.png">

but let's simplify that:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/766517343730794526/unknown.png">

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/766517904362438676/unknown.png">

here (in purple) we have the score section. there you can click to see more details about a score. clicking you go to this screen:

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/766521204194279434/unknown.png">

here you have the back button on the left and the watch button on the right. the design of the screens here is in a way that the user can't miss click the WATCH button to watch the replay without going from the left to the right of the screen.

that's something that mobile apps and webapps aren't doing at all, even though they want to get information about where the user is heading at towards the app usage path.

i think we should have a design that should be simple and intuitive, but at the same time, prevent miss clicks from the user so they can have a better experience with the app and so apps can track better their users.

TITLE> my solution for the FizzBuzz test
p> today i worked on a test mentioned in <a href="https://youtu.be/QPZ0pIK_wsc">this video by Tom Scott

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPZ0pIK_wsc/maxresdefault.jpg">
</a>

the first button shows what i have done in 2-3 minutes, and the other one shows a better version of it.

<a href="other/FizzBuzz.html">here</a> you can see the result

what i noticed about my coding style is that i like to think ahead into the future. i was asking myself if i should simplify the code a little more and i was worried about someone trying to understand my code and if to change something was easy to do. that's why i tried to make a code fast and after that works i tried to make it better.

at the same time, you can see with the first try that i did not output exactly what was proposed. i output "3" instead of "Fizz", "5" instead of "Buzz" and "3 e 5" instead of "FizzBuzz". that's something i could work on from now on.

olha como surgiram plays no score
a play em <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1010280#taiko/2114848">Kageyama Shota - Sentou! Denshousha Higana (Muzukashii)</a> acabou subindo 11pp, sendo que era #9 melhor play, isso é muita coisa

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430201054173462548/760732733935845416/unknown.png">
Sentou! Denshousha Higana (Muzukashii) com dificuldade de 2.84*, atualmente tem 3.29*

eu ganhei pp e parece que a maioria perdeu bastante pp, por isso acabei subindo de 18k pra 10k
isso provavelmente é pq muita gente tinha plays de farm, e agora essas plays não valem nada
como por exemplo as plays em <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/928431#taiko/1939224">Nog - Aether Ritual (Ritual Oni)</a>
